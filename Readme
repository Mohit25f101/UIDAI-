## 📌 Project Overview
The **Aadhaar Enrolment Intelligence System (AEIS)** is a real-time analytics dashboard designed to empower UIDAI officials with data-driven insights. It solves key challenges in the enrolment ecosystem:
1.  **Operational Visibility:** Real-time tracking of enrolments across states & districts.
2.  **Fraud Detection:** AI-based anomaly detection to flag suspicious spikes in enrolments/updates.
3.  **Future Planning:** ML-powered forecasting to predict resource demand.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 📊 Central Command Center (Overview)
- Real-time KPIs: Total Enrolments, Updates Pending, Critical Alerts.
- Interactive Filters: Drill down data by State (e.g., UP, Maharashtra).
- Trend Analysis: Daily vs Monthly growth charts.

### 2. 🚨 AI Anomaly Detection
- **Fraud Guard:** Automatically detects statistical outliers (e.g., 200% spike in updates in a single day).
- **Visual Evidence:** Scatter plots highlighting anomalies in 🔴 Red.
- **Actionable Lists:** Generates downloadable reports of suspicious districts.

### 3. 🔮 Predictive Forecasting
- Uses historical data to predict enrolment volume for the next 30 days.
- Helps in resource allocation (Machines/Staff deployment).

### 4. 🗺️ Geographic Penetration
- Interactive Map showing density of enrolments across India.
- Color-coded markers for quick situational awareness.
